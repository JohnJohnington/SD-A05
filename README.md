## A05-Autonomous Data Telemetry for Amateur Radio Satellites

Amateur radio satellites are low earth orbiting (LEO) and their pass overhead is brief and often occurs at inopportune times during the week and weekend. 
The Senior Project is to automate the process for data telemetry downlink and uplink from and to the satellite with autonomous control with the regulations 
of the federal communication Commission (FCC). This capability is not available in the community and would be an asset to such communication.
The process will utilize exact time and date information from the Internet and control of the VHF/UHF transceiver at K3TU. Hardware design of the interface and significant software design is required. For uploading data an Amateur Radio license is required
